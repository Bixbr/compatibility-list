# Azahar Compatibility List
This repository contains compatibility data for the Azahar emulator.
Compatibility is ranked on a scale from 0 to 5 where the lower the number, the better the compatibility. The number 99 is used to designate games which have not been tested.

Notably, Vulkan is not included in this compatibility list, as it is considered to be in an unstable state. Compatibility reports should only be made against the OpenGL renderer
